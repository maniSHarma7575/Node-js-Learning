# MongoUI: MongoUI (mongoui) is a web (browser) admin interface for MongoDB.

MongoUI is an open-source web and desktop app which allows to administer local and remote MongoDB instances via GUI. No need to type commands in a terminal anymore. Convenient interface will allow to create, update, remove and filter/search documents. You can switch between collections or even databases with just a single click.

Currently a standalone tool (run as an app locally or on your server); desktop app later. This is a brand new v2 of MongoUI. Old version use DerbyJS, then new version uses Webpack, React, React Router, React Bootstrap and of course Express and Node.

MongoUI v2 looks like this ([gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/azat-co/mongoui/master/mongoui.gif)):

Here's another short [**video**](https://vimeo.com/222012000) that shows filtering, editing, and switching collections:

## Why

Tired of typing `db.users.findOne({_id:ObjectId(...)})` just to look up data structure. Even more typing to modify the data. Not happy with the user experience of other MongoDB admin tools?

Meet MongoUI! Alternative to [exprss-mongo](https://github.com/andzdroid/mongo-express) and [Robomongo](https://robomongo.org).

or HTTPS

```bash
git clone https://github.com/azat-co/mongoui.git

```

```


---

## Usage


### Build and Run MongoUI in Regular Mode

```
npm start
```

Then, open <http://localhost:3001> in your favorite browser. Enjoy!


### Build and Run MongoUI in Development (Hot-Reload) Mode

Front-end development in one terminal:

```
npm run start-dev
```


Open <http://localhost:3000/> in your favorite browser.

Note: there are two ports, 3001 and 3000. In dev mode you need to go to 3000, in regular mode, navigate to 3001. This is because in dev mode, we are using webpack dev server on 3000 and the API (index.js) is alway on 3001.

## Additional Tasks


You'll need MongoDB running for MongoUI to work:

```
mongod
```


Front-end build:

```
npm run build
```


### Configs

Configurations are in the `config.json` file. Modify as needed (remote databases should work just fine!).

```js
{
  "database": {
    "default": {
      "host": "localhost",
      "port": 27017,
      "name": "mongoui",
      "username": "",
      "password": ""
    }
  }
}
```
